# ATM Machine
## What's this project about?
This project is about creating an ATM Machine that simply allows deposits and withdrawals using React and Bootstrap.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download two files:
   ·  standalone.html
   ·  ATMMachine.jsx
- Notice that the standalone.html file is where your React app will be loaded inside the root element, also where the "ATMMachine.jsx" is being linked.
- The ATMMachine.jsx file is the main component of your React application. This is where most of the code goes.
- Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root , which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files)
- Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
- Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser
- Also, you may need a local server to test the application, so in the terminal, in the directory where you save these files, run the command "npx serve" to get you own http server
  
## What's next?
A lot of functionality can be added to this use case of an ATM Machine, one may try to add as many functions that can make an ATM Machine to work as a bank user would want to.

## ATM improvements:
- When submitting an amount, either for deposit or withdrawal/cash back, the input box is automatically cleared.
- Disable the submit button when the amount that is desired to withdraw is greater than the total account balance.
